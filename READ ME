#PRODIGY_CS_01
HI,
HERE I AM DOING THE FIRST PROJECT OF CYBER SECURITY(CS) INTERNSHIP OF PRODIGY INFOTECH.
PROJECT NAME- Implement Caesar Cipher
TASK DESCRIPTION- Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.
PROJECT CORRELATION IN REAL LIFE - Caesar cipher serves as a useful educational tool for understanding the basics of encryption, its simplicity and vulnerability make it inadequate for modern security needs. Contemporary encryption methods, characterized by their complexity and robust security features, are essential for protecting sensitive information in todayâ€™s digital landscape.
DEFINITION -A substitution cipher where each letter in plaintext is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
HISTORICAL ASPECT- In the name of Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
THANK YOU.
